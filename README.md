# Technical Specifications

## Architecture

The architecture of the Sunset Android App project follows the principles of Clean Architecture.

### MVVM 

MVVM, which stands for Model-View-ViewModel, is a popular architectural pattern used in Android app development to separate concerns and create a more organized and maintainable codebase.


Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of your application. It encapsulates the data that the app works with and provides methods to interact with that data. This can include database operations, network requests, or any other data-related functionality.

View: The View represents the user interface elements of your app, such as activities, fragments, or UI components. It is responsible for displaying data to the user and handling user input. In the MVVM pattern, the View is kept as passive as possible, meaning it should only deal with the presentation of data and user interactions, without containing business logic.

ViewModel: The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It holds the data that the View needs to display and provides methods for the View to interact with the Model. ViewModel is also responsible for managing the app's state, which is essential for maintaining a responsive and efficient user interface. It ensures that the View always displays the most up-to-date data from the Model.


## Language 

<img src="https://kotlinlang.org/assets/images/twitter/general.png" width="280" height="130">

Android mobile development has been Kotlin-first since Google I/O in 2019. A modern programming language that makes developers happier.

Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language aimed to make developers happier. It‚Äôs concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.

## Jetpack Compose

Sunset app leverages 100% Jetpack Compose for creating our user interfaces, and here's why it's a significant advantage:

Jetpack Compose is a modern Android UI toolkit developed by Google, designed to simplify and enhance the process of building user interfaces for Android apps. It replaces the traditional XML-based layouts with a declarative approach, which means that we describe what our UI should look like based on its current state, rather than manually manipulating the UI elements.

The advantages of using Jetpack Compose are numerous. Firstly, it greatly improves developer productivity by providing a more intuitive and concise way to define UI elements, reducing boilerplate code and making the UI codebase easier to read and maintain. This declarative approach also helps in building responsive and dynamic UIs.
